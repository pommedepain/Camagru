# CAMAGRU

1st Web Project after the PHP swimming pool (42 intense web formation of 2 weeks).

<b>Summary:</b> We had to realize, in PHP, our first instagram-like website, allowing users to make and share photomontages. The idea was to implement (without frameworks) a first user based application.

## What is Camagru ?

This web project's goal is to create a small web application allowing users to make basic photo editing using their webcam and some predefined images in alpha channel. Appâ€™s users should be able to select an image in a list of superposable images (for instance a picture frame). All captured images should be public, likeables and commentable.
We had to use only PHP language to create our server-side application, with just the standard library. Client-side, our pages had to be in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
